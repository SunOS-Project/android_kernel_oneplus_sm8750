	help
	  Say Y here to enable the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QGauge driver
	  which uses the periodic sampling of the battery voltage and current
	  to determine the battery state-of-charge (SOC) and supports other
	  battery management features.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  The QPNP SMB5 charger driver supports the charger peripheral
	  present in the chip.
	  The power supply and iio frameworks are used to communicate battery
	  and usb properties to userspace and other driver consumers such
	  as fuel gauge, USB, and USB-PD.
	  VBUS and VCONN regulators are registered for supporting OTG,
	  and powered Type-C cables respectively.

	  Say Y to include support for SMB1390 Charge Pump driver based on
	  power supply framework.
	  SMB1390 is a div2 charge pump capable of delivering 6A charge current
	  with very high efficiency. It can work either as 2s to 1s pre-regulator
	  or as a companion charger when paired with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.â€™s
	  family of standalone chargers to enable a high current, low profile
	  Li+ battery charging system.
